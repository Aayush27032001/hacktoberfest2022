This is a special repository for basic Javascript challenges for Hacktoberfest 2022. I will keep adding issues which you are free to solve and raise a PR. 

This is refresher cum challenge task. You can refresh the content from the Refresher.md and then try to solve the issues that are applicable to the respective folders.

To contribute to this repo:

1. Star it.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Clone it onto your Computer.
4. Create a folder with your github username.
5. Create seperate files for all the issues you are solving.
6. Open PRs for the issues you are solving. (You can open multiple PRs for different issues by branching).
7. You must share a screenshot of your executable program code.

Important:
A PR that doesn't solve an issue will NOT be accepted. Multiple people are allowed to work on the same issue, however I will close an issue after more than 5 people have solved it. 

Open PRs only after 1st october otherwise it wont count.

## You can create a folder with your name at this level and commit.
